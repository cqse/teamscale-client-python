# Installation
Install via:
    
    pip install teamscale-client
    
# Setup
Copy the file `examples/.teamscale-client.config` into your home directory and update it to reflect your setup. 

# Development
We are happy to add additional service calls to the client. Please make sure you include a test, if you add a service call. To run them use:

    python setup.py test

Tests are written using the [responses library](https://pypi.org/project/responses/), to mock the requests passed to the server using the [requests api](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
